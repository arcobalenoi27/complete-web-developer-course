    <p>Here is some  <b>bold</b> text</p>

    <p>Here  is some more text</p>
    <!--One use of the paragrapsh tag is to get us a new line -->

    <p>Here  is some  text <br> with  a line break</p>
    <!-- with the br tag, we have a new line, but it's slightly different to the new paragraph
      br is a self-closing tag(doesn't have closing tag), beacause it 's just a line breaking  , you
      may  also see  br with a slash like   <br />, this is when you using xhtml, we don't need to worry
      about this point, but you can look up if you want to know more about it -->
