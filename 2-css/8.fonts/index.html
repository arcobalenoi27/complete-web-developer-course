      <!-- What this is is a link to external stylesheet, We're going to be seeing how we can use those
      in our own websites in couple of video times. it's good oppurtunity to see what they are.
      But the internal CSS for production websites is not a great solution, because it means you have to
      copy this CSS on to every page which means we have to download the everytime on the user, but protentially
       have to be updated several pages everytime you change it.
      So the general solution for production CSS is that have it in complete several files that means only has been
      stored on your server wants, and only has been downloaded by the user wants. Even though they visited several
       differnt pages on your site. And the way to do that is using this link code here.  -->
      <style type="text/css">
          p {
            font-family: 'Arima Madurai', cursive;
          }
